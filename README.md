# Taking-a-Rain-Check

Created a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.

# DataSet
The Data set contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. The csv file can be found in the repository itself of at Kaggle (here : https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

# Accuracy
About 85% accuracy has been acheived on VALIDATION and TEST set, which can be improved by feeding more dataset on it.
